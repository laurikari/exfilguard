# ExfilGuard clients configuration
#
# Clients map source IPs to policies. Selectors must not overlap; if none match,
# the fallback client determines which policies apply.
#
# Recommended: Add your clients in /etc/exfilguard/clients.d/*.toml
# rather than editing this file, so package upgrades don't conflict.
#
# See https://laurikari.github.io/exfilguard/configuration/ for full documentation.

# Default fallback denies all traffic. Add specific client rules above this.
[[client]]
name = "default"
cidr = "0.0.0.0/0"
policies = ["deny-all"]
fallback = true

# Example: Allow specific subnet with custom policies (uncomment to enable)
# [[client]]
# name = "app-servers"
# cidr = "10.0.1.0/24"
# policies = ["allow-example", "deny-all"]
